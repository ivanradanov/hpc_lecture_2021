Remarks:

N is set to 1024 currently.

Let K be the number of mpi processes.
Due to how the CUDA grid is set up, N / K must be a whole number and a multiple of 256
This means that with the current N = 1024, the MPI processes must be either 1, 2, or 4.



To compile first load modules as such:

$ module purge
$ module load intel-mpi cuda

Then compile with:

$ ./compile.sh

Then run with (for example):

$ mpiexec -np 4 ./a.out
